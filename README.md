# 3D Animated Number Shapes with Pygame

## Overview
This Python project uses Pygame to animate numerical characters in a 3D-like rotating effect. The user can input a number (0-9), and the program will display a corresponding 2D representation of that number, which rotates dynamically in a simulated 3D space.

## Features
- Interactive user input to select a numerical character (0-9).
- Animated 3D-like rotation of the chosen number.
- Pause and resume animation using the `P` key.
- Ability to change the displayed number by pressing `Enter`.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pygame**: Used for rendering the animation and handling user input.
- **Random & Math Modules**: For dynamic rotation speeds and transformations.

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/UdithaPJ/3D-Animated-Number-Shapes-with-Pygame.git
   cd 3D-Animated-Number-Shapes-with-Pygame
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. **Run the script**:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script, and it will prompt you to enter a number (0-9).
2. The selected number will be displayed and animated on the screen.
3. Press `P` to pause or resume the animation.
4. Press `Enter` to enter a new number and change the displayed character.
5. Close the window or press `ESC` to exit the program.

## Example Output
Upon running the program, a 2D representation of the chosen number will rotate in a simulated 3D effect. The animation updates dynamically based on rotation speeds.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing support for additional characters.
- Adding customizable color themes.
- Improving the 3D effect with perspective transformation.
